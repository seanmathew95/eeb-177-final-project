Paleo Project Idea

I am interested in mapping on a map of the Earth the fossil record of a group of animals through time, showing their migration patterns and evolutionary delineages. The project would timelapse the fossil record on a map through time.

Using occurrence data from the PBDB and extract fossil age and locality data and visualize the data on a world map.
